# dom_events

# Goal

There are a ton of different events that a user can trigger on DOM elements. It can be hard to choose which one is the correct one to use for some specific functionality. Also, sometimes it matters which order events happen in. Does the keyup event get triggered before or after the keypress event? Is a character typed into a text input before or after those events? This exercise will help you develop skills for answering these kinds of questions.
